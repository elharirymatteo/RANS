# Curriculum

To prevent penalties, disturbances, or tasks from being to hard from the beginning,
we use simple fixed curriculum strategies. Here fixed denotes that the rate at which
the task becomes harder is not dynamically adapting to the agent's current capacities.
Instead, it relies on the current step to set the difficulty accordingly.
